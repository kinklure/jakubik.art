<h1>Wired stump stool</h1>

Comparing to wooden stump, the wired stump stools are lighter weight. The wired stump – raw edition can be used for an occasional outdoor dining or a picnic, or as a stylish conservatory furniture. Its design draws from the wire and low poly 3D models aesthetics. The original oval wood shapes were simplified and reduced into polygonal shapes. Details as the metallic rings and unwrought welds and edges are supposed to create the impression of a cheap home-made product or a draft.</p>
